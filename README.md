### Scheme
![Scheme](minishell.png)

---

#### Developed commands

```bash
- Redirections: < > << >>
- Pipes | The output of each command in the pipeline is connected to the input of the next command via a pipe
- Environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters)
- $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline
- ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash
- Builtins
    ‚ó¶ echo with option -n
    ‚ó¶ cd with only a relative or absolute path
    ‚ó¶ pwd with no options
    ‚ó¶ export with no options
    ‚ó¶ unset with no options
    ‚ó¶ env with no options or arguments
    ‚ó¶ exit with no options

```
